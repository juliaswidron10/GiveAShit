                <h2>About our project</h2>
                <p>This website is created by travellers who got disappointed over and over again by some as what they call ‘hotspots’ all over the world. Social media makes it look like an amazing place, but in reality it can be a real disappointment. This website is created to warn other travellers for specific places or ‘hotspots’ that can be very deceiving.
                </p>



                <h2>Rating explained</h2>
                <p>It all depends on where you have travelled yourself. But it works as follows: When you have been to a specific place that you obviously didn’t like, you score that place by giving it shits. For example: you really hated the weather in Amsterdam, it couldn’t be any worse. You will rate it with 5 shits, the more shits the worse the experience.
                </p>
